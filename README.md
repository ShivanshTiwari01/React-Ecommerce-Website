# React Ecommerce Website

Prerequisites:

Git: You'll need Git installed on your system or you can just download the repository and extract it
Node.js and npm (or yarn): React apps rely on Node.js and its package manager (npm or yarn) to manage dependencies. Install them from https://nodejs.org/en/download.
Setup Instructions:

Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command, replacing <URL> with the HTTPS clone URL of your repository (available on your GitHub project page):

Bash
git clone <URL>
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Install Dependencies:

Navigate into the cloned directory using the cd command:

Bash
cd <repository-name>
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Then, install the project's dependencies using either npm or yarn (whichever your project uses):

Bash
npm install  # For npm projects
yarn install  # For yarn projects
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Start the Development Server:

Most React apps use a development server for hot reloading (seeing changes reflected in the browser without manual refresh). To start the development server, run the following command (refer to the specific command in your project's package.json script section if it differs):

Bash
npm start  # For npm projects
yarn start  # For yarn projects
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will typically start the server at http://localhost:3000 (or a similar port) in your web browser. You can then view the running React app.
